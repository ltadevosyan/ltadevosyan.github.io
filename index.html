                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am armenian. I was born in Yerevan. I studied at Parakar secondary school, which I graduated with honors. At the same time I attended piano, canon, national song and dance lessons at the Hovik Edgaryan Art School in Parakar. I have performed with a number of performances during many events, including the "Renaissance" festival in Gyumri. I was admitted and graduated with honors from Yerevan State University, Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics, with a bachelor's and master's degree. I have been a detachment leader in summer camps for several years. I participated in the charitable events of the Armenian Relief Fund. Then I taught mathematics at the Galust Gyulbenkyan High School and the Hovhannes Tumaynan Basic School in Yerevan. Now I work in Softconstruct and I study Javascript. Thank you.</p>
